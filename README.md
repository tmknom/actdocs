# actdocs

Generate documentation from Custom Actions and Reusable Workflows.

## Description

The actdocs is a utility to generate documentation from GitHub Actions in Markdown format.
It's identified Custom Actions or Reusable Workflows automatically, then formats appropriately.

## Getting Started

Documentation is generated by the following command:

```shell
actdocs generate action.yml
```

### Custom Actions

For example, write the following Custom Actions and save it as `action.yml`.

```yaml
name: Example Action
description: A example for Custom Actions.
inputs:
  hello:
    default: "Hello, world."
    required: false
    description: "A input value."
  answer:
    default: 42
    required: true
    description: "Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything."
outputs:
  result:
    value: ${{ steps.main.outputs.result }}
    description: "A output value."
runs:
  using: composite
  steps:
    - id: main
      shell: bash
      run: echo "::set-output name=result::example"
```

Run `actdocs generate action.yml`, the following Markdown is output.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```markdown
## Inputs

| Name | Description | Default | Required |
| :--- | :---------- | :------ | :------: |
| hello | A input value. | `Hello, world.` | no |
| answer | Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. | `42` | yes |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :---------- |
| result | A output value. |
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

These outputs can be sorted or injected into a specified file.
For more information, see [Usage](#usage).

### Reusable Workflows

Simply change the file you specify.

```shell
actdocs generate workflows.yml
```

The actdocs automatically switches its behavior for Reusable Workflows.

## Installation

### Download binary

Download the latest compiled binaries and put it anywhere in your executable path.

- [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/tmknom/actdocs/releases/latest)

### Pull Docker image

You can pull from Docker Hub or GitHub Packages, whichever you prefer.

**Docker Hub:**

```shell
docker pull tmknom/actdocs
```

**GitHub Packages:**

```shell
docker pull ghcr.io/tmknom/actdocs
```

### Build from source code

If you have Go 1.18+ development environment:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tmknom/actdocs
cd actdocs/
make install
actdocs --help
```

## Usage

### Injection

You can inject to existing file.
Write the injection comments to Markdown.

```markdown
<!-- actdocs start -->
<!-- actdocs end -->
```

Use `inject` command with `--file` or `-f` option.

```shell
actdocs inject --file README.md action.yml
```

Then, output is injected to the specified file.

**Note**: `inject` command can be used with `--dry-run` option to check the behavior without overwriting the file.

### Sort

You can sort items by name and required.
Run actdocs with `--sort` or `-s` option.

```shell
actdocs generate --sort action.yml
```

Of course, it can be used in combination with `inject` command.

If you prefer to sort in another way, try the following options:

- `--sort-by-name`: sort by name only
- `--sort-by-required`: sort by required only

### Format

You can format to json.
Run actdocs with `--format` option.

```shell
actdocs generate --format=json action.yml
```

Supported format is `markdown` and `json`.

### Using with Docker container

The actdocs can be run as a container by mounting a directory such as the following command:

```shell
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/work" -w "/work" tmknom/actdocs generate action.yml
```
